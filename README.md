# How to use
```diff
+ Messenger.js includes all the frontend code you need
+ websocket.js includes all the backend code you need that you have to place it in api folder
+ uploadAttachment.js is the backend you need to for uploading images and attachments to your S3 compatible object storage
+ I will not provide secrets and api keys obviously. But I also did not provide my models and other stuff you may need
